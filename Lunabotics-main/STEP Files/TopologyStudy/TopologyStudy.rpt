Run Settings
   Memory allocation for block solver: 512.0     

Parallel Processing Status
   Parallel task limit for current run:           16
   Parallel task limit for current platform:      64
   Number of processors detected automatically:   16

Checking the model before creating elements...
These checks take into account the fact that AutoGEM will
automatically create elements in volumes with material
properties, on surfaces with shell properties, and on curves
with beam section properties.
   Generate elements automatically.
Checking the model after creating elements...
Excluded elements may be required near one or more
loads due to concentrated stresses.No errors were found in the model.
