Checking the model before creating elements...
These checks take into account the fact that AutoGEM will
automatically create elements in volumes with material
properties, on surfaces with shell properties, and on curves
with beam section properties.
The rotational component of a specified constraint will have no effect 
because the surface to which it is applied is not associated 
with any shells.   Generate elements automatically.

The design study terminated abnormally.
Creo Simulate could not generate elements for all of the
entities in the model.  Use the Info->Diagnostics 
menu to review detailed messages and problem areas.

To view the model with elements, use the
File->Copy Mesh from Study... option on the AutoGEM dialog.
